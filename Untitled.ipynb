    "I managed to find a nice setup with synaptic depression. Signal propagation is succesful, but as I increase the densitiy of clusters (30% connectivity inside a gate) the chain fires in 2 or 3 waves. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I found the reason for that. I started using the parameters from the network you gave me. You used tau_e = 5ms and tau_i = 10ms. Before I had excitatory decay time set as 1.5ms. It turns out that it makes a big difference. As I excite the first gate with a strong impulse, the neurons fire and after 2ms refractory time, the g_ex is still strong (5ms decay time) so the easily neurons fire again. Inhibition is delayed (5ms) so it is too late to prevent the neurons from firing again. Previously used taue = 1.5ms seems to make sense as g_ex considerably decays after the refractory time and to excite a neuron again, some new impulse is needed. Synaptic depression has no control here as it works only on individual synapses.\n",

    "I also looked closely at the effects of depression. I start getting a feeling that it only controls the overall activity and prevents from overactivation. I'm not sure it really helps the very signal propagation. I was expecting that combination of depression and clustering will work fine and depression will prevent the gates from firing multiple times during the signal propagation. But then I noticed that there might be some other mechanism happening: it's enough to fire 10 neurons in one gate so they propagate the signal further. Those neurons not only send the signal to the next gate, but also excite other neurons in the same gate through the dense clustering. If we assume that another 10 neurons will get exited because of that - they will also send a signal to the next gate - but using different synapses, so there's no room for depression to kick in. Of course, depression still helps that the cluster doesn't stay active for too long, but this is rather a general effect of depression. \n",
    "So far I was using the clustering only in excitatory gates, clustering in inhibitory gates can help as the inhibition will also be prolonged over time. But since the inhibitory gates are small - 25 neurons, the effects will probably be small.\n",

So in essence this shows that once the recurrent connections are stronger, chains do spontaneously appear. The only trick is this 2ms time constant - the previous simulations had it set to 1.5 so they shouldn't be directly compared. \n",

    "If the integration time prolonged thanks to the taux was the only factor that causes the spontaneous sequence activation, the tau_x=5ms case would generate much more sequences. Simulations showed that it is not the case. This might give the point that the tau_x is not that crucial and the ratio between stregth of external and recurrent connection might still be the key. Admittedly, the setup os 2ms has the strongest recurrent weights (due to the effects of different taus it was impossible to use the same weights - once one parameter is changed, all the other needs to be somehow tuned). So maybe the 5ms case clearly shows that even a huge taux alone cannot guarantee the sequential activity.If this is the case, maybe sticking to the 2ms case is fine and I could move on to play with possibly a threshold to control the spontaneous signal propagation?"
